# go-diceware
Dirty, poorly written, and ineffcient diceware passphrase generator

Built mainly on code shamelessly copypasted from StackOverflow.

Expects a wordlist with a two column, whitespace-separated format. The first column is the result of 5 die rolls, and the second is the associated word.
